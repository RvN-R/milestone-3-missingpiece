# Missing Piece Website
<a href="#">View the live project here...</a>

This site is for a new and emerging company called the Missing Piece. Its designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices and have interactive elements to help meet the clients key goals. 

Missing Piece prime mission statement is to bring the UK's Live Sound Rental companies closer together, by offering a cross hire platform to aid in increased communication and clarity between all companies. Rental companies have production inventories containing loudspeakers, mixing consoles, microphones, monitor systems any and all equipment required to execute a production. Productions can range from music festivals, major touring artists headline shows, product launches or fashion shows to name but a few. In order to be in a position to cater for any and all potential productions a rental company would have to invest millions of pounds on equipment. This is obviously a massive financial investment that not all rental companies are in a position to do this. Therefore, it's common for number of rental companies in the UK to hold the same stock, that way they can hire stock off one and other in order to cover productions should they not have enough equipment on hand. Up until this point cross hiring has been a laborious task, phoning around different companies to see if they have spare stock. It stressful and time consuming, Missing Piece is offering an alternative. 

The primary goal of this website is to provide visitors the opportunity to search the Missing Piece database for avalaible equipment or register an account with Missing Piece to upload there production inventories. The website features an "About Us" section, "So How Does This Work?" section, "Search Inventory" section and "Register" section. Once an account has been registered a user can upload there inventories, once uploaded these inventories can be edited or deleted. Once uploaded they will appear on the Missing Piece database and can be seen by those using the search to find avalaible production stock.

## Design 
### Colour Scheme
During my journey trying to find inspiration for the overall aesthetic of this website I came across a fantastic image on <a  href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplashed</a> and a photographer called <a href ="https://unsplash.com/@nainoa">Nainoa Shizuru</a>. The image was taken from the perspective of someone attending a gig, and I felt met the clients brand image and also would connect with the clients key demographic. I decided to use this image as the main hero image spanning across the length of each page of the website. I then used a website called  <a  href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> and using there "create palette from photo" feature I uploaded the image from Nainoa Shizuru. I was able to pick out colours from the image that I felt would compliment the image, and reinforce the overall design to connect with the key demographic. I've included a list below of colours I ended up settling on: 
 * #fcc000  - Amber
 * #96b0d1 - Wild Blue Yonder
 * #1b1a18 - Eerie Black
 * #fee602 - Middle Yellow
 * #fdfdfd - White
 
 ### Typography
 Rubik is the font chosen fro use across the site, with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there are any issues importing into the site correctly from Google Fonts. During my research into possible font choices I came across a great article on the <a  href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards</a> website called the <a  href="https://www.awwwards.com/20-best-web-fonts-from-google-web-fonts-and-font-face.html">20 Best Google Web Fonts</a>. Some really great font's but Rubik caught my eye due its bold yet modern appearance. I felt once again that this font worked well with the overall image I wanted the websites design to possess.

 ## Features
In effect there are two different sides to the Missing Piece website that have slightly different features. The first side we would describe as the "Visitor Side". Features includes a "Home" page that includes an "About Us" section and a "So How Does This Work" section. The "Home" page also directs visitors to the "Search Inventory" page, "Register" page or the "Log In". The second side of the website we would describe as the "Members Side". Once a visitor has registered an account more features appear on the navigation bar at the top of the web page, and some features such as "Register" and "Log In" that previously appeared in the "Visitor Side" disappear. The new features that are only avalaible on the "Members Side" are "Profile", "Search Inventory", "Add To Inventory", "My Inventory" and finally "Log Out". Featured at the top of ever page is a navigation bar that runs across it's width. The navigation bar remains at the top of each bar, so users of the site know its location where ever they may be on the website. Just below the navigation bar is a large banner running the width of the page. Centered within the banner the Missing Piece logo along with a hero image used as the banners background. The colours user in the navigation bar match those used in the companies logo. To ensure continuity I've used the same Middle Yellow for the navigation bars main font colour, as the colour of the companies logo. Also on navigation bars left hand corner I have positioned the puzzle piece from the Missing Piece logo, and this is linked to the "Home" page. So no matter where the user is on the site, they know that when they click the logo they will be transported back to the "Home" page. Each page has a footer with the social media icons linking to the clients social media accounts. The footer echoes those colours used in the navigation bar, companies logo and main hero image, ensuring coherent design approach. 

### Home
The Home page features a large banner with the company logo in the centre and hero image as its background. This catches the visitors eye, and quickly connects with the intended target market that of the Live Sound Community.  Then when the user scrolls down the page they will notice two different sections, "About Us" and "So How Does This Work?". The About Us section consists four small paragraphs that quickly identify who the company is, and the whole purpose of the website. The second section "So How Does This Work?" section succinctly explains to the visitor that there are two different types of visitor that the website has be built to facilitate, those "Searching" and those that "Advertise". To do this both words have been made bold to stand out from the rest of the text. This donates to the visitor that this information is important. Just below that paragraph are two sections one for information relating to those visitors looking to search the Missing Piece database, and those visitors looking to advertise. Once again bold text has been used to denote the importance of both words, and also two different icons from "Font Awesome" have been used that have connotations to the words "Searching" and "Advertise". Finally there are two call to action buttons, using the same icons to insure continuity,  one button labelled "Search Inventory" links the user to the "Search Inventory" page and the second button labelled "Create Account" links the user to the "Register" page. Once again when the website is being used in "Visitor Side" both "About Us" and "So How Does This Work?" sections appear on the Home page. However, when the visitor has logged into the "Members Side" then only "About Us" appears on the Home page. 

### Search Inventory
The "Search Inventory" page appears the same for both the "Visitor Side" and "Members Side" of the website. Once again the navigation bar, and banner consisting of an hero image background and company logo, appear at the top of the page to ensure consistency throughout the site. In addition the footer with social media icons linking to the companies social media accounts also appear at the bottom of the page, as it does on ever page of the site. When the a visitor visits the "Search Inventory" page they will see a text input with "Search Inventories" as its label, prompting the visitor to type into it in order to search. In addition to the text input there is a button labelled "Reset" and a button labelled "Search". When the user inputs a query into the text input (say for example "Midas") and clicks the search button, results matching that search will appear. The backend of the website searches the database for matches relating to that query. If any matches are found then a card appears with the companies name that made the inventory entry, the inventory entry itself and an accordion element at the bottom of the card labelled "Click For *COMPANY NAME* Contact Details". Once clicked this accordion element will expand and show the contact details for the company that made the inventory entry. If the search query doesn't match an inventory entry found in the database then a message appears on the page that says "No Results Found". When the visitor wants to clear the search they can clear the search by clicking the "Reset" button. 
 
  ### Register
The "Register" page only appears on the "Visitor Side" the website, as once registered there's no need to see it. The navigation bar, and banner consisting of an hero image background and company logo, appear at the top of the page to ensure consistency throughout the site. In addition the footer with social media icons linking to the companies social media accounts also appear at the bottom of the page, as it does on ever page of the site. When a visitor visits the "Register" page they will see seven text inputs labelled "Username", "Password", "Company Name", "Street Name", "Postcode", "City Name" and "Phone Number". Each text input will have its own icon that matches the connotation of the text inputs label. Each text input needs to be filled out before the user hits the "Submit" button at the bottom of the form, other wise they will be promoted with a "Please fill in this field" reminder. In addition to ensure strong usernames and passwords are used when registering an account, a visitor will be promoted  with validator reminders. For example if they fail to use a username the correct length they will be promoted with "Username must be between 10 and 15 Characters".  In addition any of the information they try and register with has been used to activate an account in the past, they will also receive a message to inform them of this and there attempt to register will fail. Finally just below the "Submit" button is a link that says "Already Registered? Log In" that links the visitor to the "Log In" page.
