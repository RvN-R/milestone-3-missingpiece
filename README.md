# Missing Piece Website
<a href="#">View the live project here...</a>

This site is for a new and emerging company called the Missing Piece. Its designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices and have interactive elements to help meet the clients key goals. 

Missing Piece prime mission statement is to bring the UK's Live Sound Rental companies closer together, by offering a cross hire platform to aid in increased communication and clarity between all companies. Rental companies have production inventories containing loudspeakers, mixing consoles, microphones, monitor systems any and all equipment required to execute a production. Productions can range from music festivals, major touring artists headline shows, product launches or fashion shows to name but a few. In order to be in a position to cater for any and all potential productions a rental company would have to invest millions of pounds on equipment. This is obviously a massive financial investment that not all rental companies are in a position to do this. Therefore, it's common for number of rental companies in the UK to hold the same stock, that way they can hire stock off one and other in order to cover productions should they not have enough equipment on hand. Up until this point cross hiring has been a laborious task, phoning around different companies to see if they have spare stock. It stressful and time consuming, Missing Piece is offering an alternative. 

The primary goal of this website is to provide visitors the opportunity to search the Missing Piece database for avalaible equipment or register an account with Missing Piece to upload there production inventories. The website features an "About Us" section, "So How Does This Work?" section, "Search Inventory" section and "Register" section. Once an account has been registered a user can upload there inventories, once uploaded these inventories can be edited or deleted. Once uploaded they will appear on the Missing Piece database and can be seen by those using the search to find avalaible production stock.

## Design 
### Colour Scheme
During my journey trying to find inspiration for the overall aesthetic of this website I came across a fantastic image on <a  href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplashed</a> and a photographer called <a href ="https://unsplash.com/@nainoa">Nainoa Shizuru</a>. The image was taken from the perspective of someone attending a gig, and I felt met the clients brand image and also would connect with the clients key demographic. I decided to use this image as the main hero image spanning across the length of each page of the website. I then used a website called  <a  href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> and using there "create palette from photo" feature I uploaded the image from Nainoa Shizuru. I was able to pick out colours from the image that I felt would compliment the image, and reinforce the overall design to connect with the key demographic. I've included a list below of colours I ended up settling on: 
 * #fcc000  - Amber
 * #96b0d1 - Wild Blue Yonder
 * #1b1a18 - Eerie Black
 * #fee602 - Middle Yellow
 * #fdfdfd - White
 
 ### Typography
 Rubik is the font chosen fro use across the site, with Sans Serif as the back up font in case there are any issues importing into the site correctly from Google Fonts. During my research into possible font choices I came across a great article on the <a  href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards</a> website called the <a  href="https://www.awwwards.com/20-best-web-fonts-from-google-web-fonts-and-font-face.html">20 Best Google Web Fonts</a>. Some really great font's but Rubik caught my eye due its bold yet modern appearance. I felt once again that this font worked well with the overall image I wanted the websites design to possess.

 ## Features
In effect there are two different sides to the Missing Piece website that have slightly different features. The first side we would describe as the "Visitor Side". Features includes a "Home" page that includes an "About Us" section and a "So How Does This Work" section. The "Home" page also directs visitors to the "Search Inventory" page, "Register" page or the "Log In". The second side of the website we would describe as the "Members Side". Once a visitor has registered an account more features appear on the navigation bar at the top of the web page, and some features such as "Register" and "Log In" that previously appeared in the "Visitor Side" disappear. The new features that are only avalaible on the "Members Side" are "Profile", "Search Inventory", "Add To Inventory", "My Inventory" and finally "Log Out". Featured at the top of ever page is a navigation bar that runs across it's width. The navigation bar remains at the top of each bar, so users of the site know its location where ever they may be on the website. Just below the navigation bar is a large banner running the width of the page. Centered within the banner the Missing Piece logo along with a hero image used as the banners background. The colours user in the navigation bar match those used in the companies logo. To ensure continuity I've used the same Middle Yellow for the navigation bars main font colour, as the colour of the companies logo. Also on navigation bars left hand corner I have positioned the puzzle piece from the Missing Piece logo, and this is linked to the "Home" page. So no matter where the user is on the site, they know that when they click the logo they will be transported back to the "Home" page. Each page has a footer with the social media icons linking to the clients social media accounts. The footer echoes those colours used in the navigation bar, companies logo and main hero image, ensuring coherent design approach. 

### Home
The Home page features a large banner with the company logo in the centre and hero image as its background. This catches the visitors eye, and quickly connects with the intended target market that of the Live Sound Community.  Then when the user scrolls down the page they will notice two different sections, "About Us" and "So How Does This Work?". The About Us section consists four small paragraphs that quickly identify who the company is, and the whole purpose of the website. The second section "So How Does This Work?" section succinctly explains to the visitor that there are two different types of visitor that the website has be built to facilitate, those "Searching" and those that "Advertise". To do this both words have been made bold to stand out from the rest of the text. This donates to the visitor that this information is important. Just below that paragraph are two sections one for information relating to those visitors looking to search the Missing Piece database, and those visitors looking to advertise. Once again bold text has been used to denote the importance of both words, and also two different icons from "Font Awesome" have been used that have connotations to the words "Searching" and "Advertise". Finally there are two call to action buttons, using the same icons to insure continuity,  one button labelled "Search Inventory" links the user to the "Search Inventory" page and the second button labelled "Create Account" links the user to the "Register" page. Once again when the website is being used in "Visitor Side" both "About Us" and "So How Does This Work?" sections appear on the Home page. However, when the visitor has logged into the "Members Side" then only "About Us" appears on the Home page. 

### Search Inventory
The "Search Inventory" page appears the same for both the "Visitor Side" and "Members Side" of the website. Once again the navigation bar, and banner consisting of an hero image background and company logo, appear at the top of the page to ensure consistency throughout the site. In addition the footer with social media icons linking to the companies social media accounts also appear at the bottom of the page, as it does on ever page of the site. When the a visitor visits the "Search Inventory" page they will see a text input with "Search Inventories" as its label, prompting the visitor to type into it in order to search. In addition to the text input there is a button labelled "Reset" and a button labelled "Search". When the user inputs a query into the text input (say for example "Midas") and clicks the search button, results matching that search will appear. The backend of the website searches the database for matches relating to that query. If any matches are found then a card appears with the companies name that made the inventory entry, the inventory entry itself and an accordion element at the bottom of the card labelled "Click For *COMPANY NAME* Contact Details". Once clicked this accordion element will expand and show the contact details for the company that made the inventory entry. If the search query doesn't match an inventory entry found in the database then a message appears on the page that says "No Results Found". When the visitor wants to clear the search they can clear the search by clicking the "Reset" button. 
 
  ### Register
The "Register" page only appears on the "Visitor Side" the website, as once registered there's no need to see it. The navigation bar, and banner consisting of an hero image background and company logo, appear at the top of the page to ensure consistency throughout the site. In addition the footer with social media icons linking to the companies social media accounts also appear at the bottom of the page, as it does on ever page of the site. When a visitor visits the "Register" page they will see seven text inputs labelled "Username", "Password", "Company Name", "Street Name", "Postcode", "City Name" and "Phone Number". Each text input will have its own icon that matches the connotation of the text inputs label. Each text input needs to be filled out before the user hits the "Submit" button at the bottom of the form, other wise they will be promoted with a "Please fill in this field" reminder. In addition to ensure strong usernames and passwords are used when registering an account, a visitor will be promoted  with validator reminders. For example if they fail to use a username the correct length they will be promoted with "Username must be between 10 and 15 Characters".  In addition any of the information they try and register with has been used to activate an account in the past, they will also receive a message to inform them of this and there attempt to register will fail. Finally just below the "Submit" button is a link that says "Already Registered? Log In" that links the visitor to the "Log In" page.  

### Log In
The "Log In" page only appears on the "Visitor Side" of the website, as once logged in there's no need for the user to continue to see it. The navigation bar and footer remain the same location as all of the other pages to ensure consistency throughout the site. When a visitor visits the "Log In" page they will see two text inputs labelled "Username" and "Password" with icons that match the connotations of both labels. To ensure continuity to the "Register" page both text inputs are identical to those when the user registered there account. In addition the call to action button labelled "Log In" is he same has the same colours and hover effects as all other buttons found throughout the site to ensure continuity. Once the user inputs a username and password they click the "Log In" button. If the details match any found on the database then they will be taken to there "Profile" page. If not then a message will appear "Incorrect Username and/or Password" prompting them to recheck the log in information they are using. Finally just below the "Log In" button is a link that says "New Here? Register Account" that links the visitor to the "Register" page. This ensures improved user experience that if someone mistakenly arrives at "Log In" and doesn't have an account, they can register one quickly. 

### Profile
The "Profile" page only appears on the "Members Side" of the website, as you have to have registered an account in order to have a profile. Once the user logs in as described above, they will be directed to the "Profile" page. The navigation bar and footer remain the same location as all of the other pages to ensure consistency throughout the site. At the top of the page will be a welcome message, welcoming the user and letting them know they have successfully logged in. Just below that message is a heading that says "COMPANY NAME Profile" and below that is a card containing the same company information ("Street Name", "Postcode", "City Name" and "Phone Number") that they registered. This company information also appears in the search results. As mentioned above then a visitor searches the database, all matching inventory entries will appear, a long with the contact company information for the company that entered said inventory entry. Below the card containing the company information is a call to action button labelled "Update Info". I wanted to offer the user the option to edit there company information once registered. When you clicked a page will appear with five text inputs labelled Company Name", "Street Name", "Postcode", "City Name" and "Phone Number". Each input will be autofilled with the information that they last inputed. At the bottom of the page is two call to action buttons labelled "Cancel" and "Update" The user can click "Cancel" and be taken back to there profile page. Alternatively they can edit any of the text inputs and then click the "Update" button at the bottom of the page. The website will then take them back to there profile page where they will see that the contact information has been changed to match the edits they have made, and a message saying "Company Details Updated" will appear.

### Add Inventory
The "Add Inventory" page only appears on the "Members Side" of the website, as you have to have registered an account in order to have a profile to upload too. The navigation bar and footer remain the same location as all of the other pages to ensure consistency throughout the site. When the user first arrives at the "Add Inventory" page they will see a sub title that instructs the user on how the page functions. Below that there is a form that contains a select component, and three text inputs. The select component is labelled Category, and has a prompt that says "Choose your Category" that suggests to the user that they need to select there choice of category. When clicked four category options will appear "Loudspeakers", "Microphones", "Mixing Console" and "Monitors". In the future this drop down will contain more options, as there is a multitude of different categories of product a Rental Company could choose have in there production inventories. However, the four I have used are the most popular and pivotal. Once chosen the user needs to input a brand name, a product name and a quantity of how many they have in there physical rental inventories. Each input once clicked will have a red line underneath it until a value is inputed. Once inputed that red line will change to green, to inform the user to move on and fill out the next text input. Once the form is filled out then the user can click the call to action button at the bottom of the page entitled "Add To Inventory". Once clicked the form will refresh and a message will appear at the top of the page saying "Inventory Successfully Added". The user can then go to the "My Inventory" page and that inventory entry will appear along with any entries they have made up until that point. 

### My Inventory
The "My Inventory" page only appears on the "Members Side" of the website, as you have to have registered an account in order to have a profile to upload too. The navigation bar and footer remain the same location as all of the other pages to ensure consistency throughout the site. When a user first arrives at the "My Inventory" page they will see a card for each inventory entry they have added using the "Add Inventory" page. Each card will inform them on the name of the category, name of the brand, name of the product and how many units of that product the user has in there inventory. Finally there are two call to action buttons labelled "Edit" and "Delete" per card. If a user wants to edit any of the information on the card they can click the "Edit" button. When they do they will be transported to a page identical to the "Add Inventory" page. The form will autofill with the information from that card. There are two call to action buttons labelled "Cancel" and "Confirm Edit" at the bottom of the page. If the user clicks cancel they will be taken page to there "My Inventory" page. However, if the user edits the information of that entry, clicks "Confirm Edit" button then they will be taken back to the "My Inventory" page. They will see a message that says "Inventory Successfully Updated" and they will see the information on the Inventory entry change to match the changes they have just made. Finally should the user want to delete an entry entirely they can click the "Delete" button. In doing so a modal will appear with a warning, it will ask the user if they want to delete the inventory. If they click no then the modal will close, if they click yes then that inventory entry will disappear, and a message "Inventory Successfully Deleted" will appear. The modal adds another level of security, to prevent a user from accidentally deleting an entry. 

### Log Out
This isn't a page but it is a feature, and appears on the navigation bar on the "Members Side" of the website. Once clicked the user will be logged out of there account and transported to "Visitors Side" and the "Log In" page.

## Existing Features
* Header Logo - Exists on every page and allows the user to easily recognise the clients brand. Clicking the logo returns the user to the home page. 

* Header Navigation Bar - appears at the top of each page in the same location, ensuring the user knows to where to locate it no matter location on the website. 

* Remote View Navigation Bar - In remote screen sizes a full size navigation bar would get overbearing and take up much needed screen space. Remote view will allow users to toggle to the remote view navigation bar to better navigate around the site. 

* Footer Social Icons - Exist at the bottom of the page and allow the visitor to access the club's social media platforms. 

* Call to Action Buttons - found through out the site. Allows the users to quickly access key information or key features. 

* About Us - This section appears on the home page. Allows visitors to understand the clients journey, brand image and mission statement. 

* "So, How Does This Work ?" - This section appears on the home page. It allows the user to understand the two key uses of the website, and then using call to action buttons help navigate the user to the correct areas of the site depending on what they are looking to achieve. 

* Modal for Deleting Inventory - Protects the user from accidentally deleting an inventory entry, which once deleted can't be undone.

* Search - Allows the user to search the inventory database for other inventories that include product that they would like to rent for an event. 

*  Add Inventory - Allows the user the ability to upload an inventory entry to the database.

* Edit Inventory - Allows the user the ability to edit an of the inventory entries they have uploaded to the database. 

* Edit Profile Information - Allows the user the ability to edit there company information that they previously registered with. 

## Features Left to Implement
* GDPR Checkbox - Allows the user to approve the use of their email address to inform them of future actions. Also ensures the client complies with EU data protection law. 

* Addition to  category select component in the "Add Inventory" form - This is relatively easy to do as the category select component is linked to a categories database in MongoDB. So all someone has to do is input more category options and these will appear when the user clicks the select component. 

* Add subscription service - As the company grows a subscription service to advertise inventories on the Missing Piece database will be employed. When a user gets to a limit of 5 entries they will have to pay a monthly subscription fee to advertise more inventory entires. 

* Processing Payments - When the subscription service starts a payment processing API will be required in order to process subscription payments. 

* Decrease Manual Element to "Adding Inventory" - At present a user has to input each Inventory entry using the "Add Inventory" page. However, if you are a large rental company with a massive inventory then this process could easily become laborious. A number of these large companies have internal database that they use to manage the incoming and outgoing stock from there rental inventories. Each piece of equipment has a bar code, that bar code is scanned when it leaves the warehouse for productions, and scanned when they are returned. At this point the Missing Piece is still at its initial stages so more research needs to be done into how these databases store this information. However, the long term goal  would be to write some code that dumps the data from this database at the end of everyday and upload to the Missing Piece database. This would keep the users actual rental inventory up to date with there missing piece profile.

## Credits
### Code 
* I used an interesting Stack Overflow thread on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50002386/iterating-multiple-lists-in-parallel-with-python-inside-html-flask?noredirect=1&lq=1">Iterating multiple lists in parallel with Python inside HTML(Flask)</a>, as inspiration when it came to iterating over my "inventories" and "users" database. When a user runs a search on the "Search Inventory" page, I wanted not only inventory entries that matched the search query to appear, but also company information of the company that uploaded said inventory entry. This article helped me achieve this. 

* I found another interesting Stack Overflow thread on  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30056622/how-to-iterate-over-a-list-of-list-in-jinja"> how to iterate over a list of list in Jinja</a>. I used this technique to help make the inventory entry's appear when searched on the "Search Inventory" page as well as the company information. 

* I watched a YouTube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzaXBm-ZVOQ">Pretty Printed</a> explaining how to install and get started with Flask WTF. This allowed me to quickly setup forms for the websites "Register" and "Log In" pages with effective form validators. 

* I used a Materalize component called <a href="https://materializecss.com/cards.html">"Cards"</a> for the "My Inventory", "Search Inventory" and "Profile" 

* I used various Materalize Forms including <a href="https://materializecss.com/select.html">"Select"</a>  and <a href="https://materializecss.com/select.html">"Text Inputs"</a>, which can be found on the "Register", "Log In", and "Add Inventory" pages. 

* I used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/">Bootstrap Modal</a> component to create a delete inventory entry modal, which added another level of security to prevent a user from accidentally deleting an entry.
